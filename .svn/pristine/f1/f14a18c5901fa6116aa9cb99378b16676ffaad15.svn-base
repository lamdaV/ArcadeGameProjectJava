Classes in the default package are unused due to updates in the code.

Note: Digger can be set to slower speeds; however, as a design decision, we allowed the Digger to be faster than the enemy
due to their numbers in later levels and intelligent pathfinding. Furthermore, our bullets do have a delay; however, once again,
we decided to have a short delay due to difficulty and enemy intelligence.

Controls:
